## About
This is a single page static website which display the data of houses and flats. It will sort the propertiy by price and type. It also displays the location and asks you the move-in date. 

In the near future, I am looking to update it with a search functionality.

## Tech Stack 
RealEstate is built using the latest technology. To begin with, first, I did Research. Next, I started jotting down the key points and features. The tech stack is as follows:

1. React js for frontend development.
2. Chakra UI for UI Components.
3. Vercel to deploy the site live.
4. Github as an opensource to host files.
